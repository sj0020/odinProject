# 2. How Does the Web Work?

## Clients and servers
### Clients
- user's internet-connected devices
### Servers
- computers that store webpages, sites, or apps
## Other parts
### TCP/IP
- Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
- communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet

### DNS
### HTTP
### Component files
#### Code files
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
#### Assets
- other stuff (images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs)

## what happens When you type a web address into your browser

1. browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real addresss(IP)

    ⬇️ sent using TCP/IP

2. browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client
3. approval: server sends the client a "200 OK" message
4. browser renders a page

## Packets
- the format in which the data is sent from server to client
